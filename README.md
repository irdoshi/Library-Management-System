# Library-Management-System

The Library Management System is a C# solution based on Azure cloud services that allows for efficient management of library's activities. The system supports two user types: library admins and regular users. Users can borrow books, which will be updated in their profiles, and the library's inventory will be updated accordingly.

#Features

- User Authentication: Secure authentication mechanism for users to log in to their accounts.
- User Roles: Two user roles are supported: librarian admin and regular user.
- Book Management: Librarian admins can add, edit, and delete books from the library inventory.
